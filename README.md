Introduction
This repository showcases several WPF applications built using the MVVM design pattern. MVVM is a powerful architectural pattern that separates the development of the graphical user interface from the business logic and data. This helps in creating more maintainable, testable, and extensible code.

Features
Demonstrates MVVM architecture in WPF
Includes various example projects for different use cases
Clean and maintainable code
Example projects include data binding, command patterns, and more
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Visual Studio 2019 or later
.NET Framework 4.7.2 or later
Basic understanding of C# and WPF
Installation
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
sh
Copiar código
git clone https://github.com/lewisc99/wpf_mvvm_projects.git
Open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio.
Usage
Open the desired project within the solution.
Build the solution to restore the necessary packages and dependencies.

Each project is self-contained and demonstrates different aspects of the MVVM pattern.

Project Structure
Here is a high-level overview of the project structure:

Project1/ - Demonstrates basic MVVM setup with simple data binding.
Project2/ - Shows more complex MVVM scenarios including command binding.
Project3/ - Includes examples of using MVVM with different UI controls.
Common/ - Contains shared resources and utilities used across projects.
Each project folder typically contains:

Models/ - The data models.
ViewModels/ - The view models which handle the logic and interaction.
Views/ - The XAML files defining the user interface.
